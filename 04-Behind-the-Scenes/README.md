Understanding how JavaScript really works under the hood.

📌 About This Repository

This project focuses on the internal working of JavaScript — what happens behind the scenes when your code runs in the browser or Node.js.

Instead of just writing syntax, this repo helps you understand:

How JavaScript executes code

How memory is managed

How asynchronous behavior works

Because real devs don’t just write code — they understand it.

If you understand what’s happening behind the scenes, you’ll:

Debug faster

Write better optimized code

Crack technical interviews

Become a stronger JS developer

Old-school fundamentals = long-term power 💯

🛠️ Tech Used
